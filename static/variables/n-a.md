HubSpot templates can use a host of predefined variables that can be used to render useful website and email elements. This page is a reference listing of those variables. You can learn more about creating your own variables in a HubL template or module, [here](/docs/hubl/variables-macros-syntax).

While most of the variables listed on this page are optional, there are a few variables that are required, in order to create emails and pages from your templates.
